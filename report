First,I declare the question first by initialize it the static int type, then as the requirement,I make 3 function, such as, GiveQuestion(),ReadIn(),Solve(). Then I create the header file "Sudoku.h"
Second,I wrote the function GiveQuestion() by using the static myQ[12][12], then random it by row and column.. Because of I'm not so good in randoming array so that I just random it by row and column.. and I'm still trying to randomize it by number,but it fails.. then,I randomize it to have zero value to be a question.
Next, I wrote the ReadIn() function by using stdin, and read one by one the array of the question.
until it takes the question, and I started to think about how to solve it.
In the process of solving the sudoku, I have trying to get the answer,but it makes me confusing to get the right answer, then I try to get the solution by inserting number from 1 to 9. and then see if it is solvable or not.
To compile it,you just type make in the command line, because I have made a makefile file.
To execute it, I used redirection. So that, in command line type ./give_question > test and then ./solve < test
